[Agari-o-clock](http://agari-o-clock.me/) is the ultimate clock/calendar experience. Based on the popular game [Agar.io](http://agar.io/), agari-o-clock offers the same graphical experience with the added useful functionality of a clock and calendar. Never go without knowing the time or date again! 

Think that's it? No way! I've also included some famous agar.io players who stream the beautiful experience on YouTube. You will see their names come up and hear some REAL quotes by them! Players include [Bodil40](https://www.youtube.com/user/Bodil40), [Double](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFHg8Ks76oThmAaR2zFTS2w), and more! 

All perfectly orchestrated to the wonderful music composed by Sonny Moore, aka Skrillex; [Doompy Poomp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdpLGeSVjHU).
